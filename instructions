Important:
Software Design, Code Quality, Life Cycle

Goal:
Resolve the lat, long coordinates for that address using third party geocoding services
Create restful service using a HTTP interface and JSON for data serialization
Two different third part geocoding services (main and backup)
Implement own HTTP request code, don't use third party libraries to access geocoding services
Production Quality

Documentation:
How to run Service
How to use the services API

Don't need to make it scalable

HTTP interface to CLI for running the service
